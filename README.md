# Voice_assistant_ai-basic-
In this project, I designed and developed a voice assistant that utilizes speech recognition, natural language processing, and text-to-speech synthesis to provide a conversational interface for users. The voice assistant is capable of understanding and responding to user input, performing various tasks such as searching Wikipedia, opening websites, and telling jokes.

Key Features:

Speech recognition using Google's Speech Recognition API
Text-to-speech synthesis using PyTTSX3
Natural language processing using Wikipedia API and PyJokes
Integration with web browsers for opening websites
Customizable responses and interactions
Technical Details:

Programming Language: Python
Libraries and Frameworks: SpeechRecognition, PyTTSX3, Wikipedia API, PyJokes, Webbrowser
Operating System: Windows
